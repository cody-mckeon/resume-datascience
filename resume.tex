\section*{Summary}
Tech-savvy professional with a strong background in project management and marketing technology, recently transitioned into Data Science. Led a full-stack MLOps project with a focus on data versioning, model tracking, explainability, and deployment. Adept at applying ML pipelines in practical business contexts using modern open-source tools.

\section*{Experience}

\textbf{Data Scientist (Contract)} \hfill Nov 2022 -- Present \\
\textit{Independent Project | Hilton-Style MLOps Pipeline} \\
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Led the end-to-end development of a machine learning model to predict guest upsell propensity and forecast revenue.
    \item Implemented data versioning and transformation pipelines using DVC with raw/processed Parquet datasets.
    \item Built and tracked classification/regression models using XGBoost; logged runs, metrics, and artifacts with MLflow.
    \item Achieved ROC AUC of 0.713 and reduced MAE to \$1.52 using Optuna for hyperparameter optimization.
    \item Developed SHAP explainability reports highlighting key predictors like lead time and booking source.
    \item Deployed model as a FastAPI microservice containerized in Docker and published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) via CI/CD.
    \item Added drift detection automation using Evidently and planned model retraining triggers.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Marketing Technology Specialist} \hfill 2019 -- 2022 \\
\textit{Walmart Global eCommerce} \\

\end{itemize}

\section*{Projects}

\textbf{Vacation Ownership Demand Forecasting (MLOps Case Study)} \\
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Used a Kaggle hotel booking dataset to simulate real-world demand and upsell forecasting.
    \item Created features including lead time, is\_weekend, revenue, and encoded categorical fields.
    \item Developed model pipeline with MLflow tracking and Optuna tuning to optimize performance.
    \item Deployed model with FastAPI + Docker, published to GHCR, and configured GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
    \item Simulated production drift using Evidently to demonstrate model monitoring and alerting.
\end{itemize}
